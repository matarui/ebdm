## Session Preparation 

### What is research synthesis?

Whatch this short introduction to research synthesis to learn more about it and we need it (ca. 5 minutes).

### A short primer on research synthesis

Read the paper by **Gurevitch et al. (2018)** for a short overview of the history of research synthesis (60 minutes). 

Gurevitch, J., Koricheva, J., Nakagawa, S., & Stewart, G. (2018). Meta-analysis and the science of research synthesis. *Nature, 555*(7695), 175â€“182.  [http://doi.org/10.1038/nature25753](https://github.com/matarui/ebdm/raw/main/docs/literature/Gurevitch_2018_Nature.pdf)

### Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)

Are you familiar with the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)" and the associated [website](http://prisma-statement.org)?

Take a few minutes to look into the [website](http://prisma-statement.org/Default.aspx) and read the paper by **Page et al. (2021)** (60 minutes), paying particular attention to the checklist and flow diagrams presented. 

Do you recognize important differences or similarities with the CONSORT guidelines?

### Additional (optional) task

Pick a systematic literature search and/or meta-analysis that you are familiar with or search for one using an literature database of your choice. To what extent does the report follow the PRISMA guidelines?
