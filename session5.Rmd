### Superforecasting

Are good forecasters born or made? How can one best design teams to produce better forecasts? 

In this session, we cover work from the *Good Judgment Project* that has focused on answering these and related questions. Check out an interview by Phil Tetlock and read **Mellers & Tetlock (2019).** (ca. 60 minutes) for an overview of the Good Judgment Project and its main insights.
