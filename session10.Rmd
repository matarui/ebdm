# PRISMA

Are you familiar with the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)" and the associated [website](http://prisma-statement.org)?

Take a few minutes to look into the [website](http://prisma-statement.org/Default.aspx) and read the paper by Page et al. (2021) referenced below (60 minutes), paying particular attention to the checklist and flow diagrams presented. 

Do you recognize important differences or similarities with the CONSORT guidelines discussed in [Session 7](session7.html)?
