## Session Preparation

### Counterfactuals, counterfactuals, counterfactuals everywhere

There are many ways to make inferences but most (all?!?) forms of causal inference involve some form of counterfactual. Take some time to think about the concept of counterfactuals by watching this short intro (5 minutes).

### Recommended Reading

Read **Varian (2016)** (ca. 120 minutes) to get an overview of causal inference strategies in economics and marketing from the Chief Economist at Google, Hal Varian. 

Varian, H. R. (2016). Causal inference in economics and marketing. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 113*(27), 7310â€“7315. [http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1510479113](https://github.com/matarui/ebdm/raw/main/docs/literature/Varian_2016_PNAS.pdf)
