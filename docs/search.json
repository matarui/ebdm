The main premise of the course is that\ninformed decisions require the use of evidence (i.e., data that has been\nprocessed in some way to generate knowledge or insight).\nThe behavioral sciences, such as psychology and economics, have\ndeveloped a number of concepts and techniques - a methodological toolbox\n- designed to transfrom data into evidence. This course aims to unpack\nsome of these tools and showcase how they can be used in practice.\nThe overarching theme of the course is that evidence-based decision\nmaking uses the tools of science to help us make better, informed\ndecisions. This theme is reflected in the structure of the course: After\nthe first two introductory sessions, the course is divided into modules\ncovering 5 different scientific “methods”, specifically, the benefits\nand limits of formalization (Algorithms), the\ndiscussion and amalgamation of diverse opinions\n(Consensus), the use of experiments and other methods\nto infer causality (Counterfactuals), the comprehensive\nand unbiased summary of multiple studies (Synthesis),\nand the establishment of guidelines and interventions based on the best\npossible evidence (Interventions).\nWhat can you expect to learn?\nThe course will cover broad theoretical principles of evidence-based\ndecision making. The principles will be illustrated with examples, that\nis, a few simple tutorials with example code in R, and other recommended exercises\ndesigned to facilitate understanding of the underlying concepts.\nBy completing\nthe course you can expect to LEARN…\ncentral concepts in evidence-based decision making\ngeneral principles of causal inference\nbasic statistical concepts (e.g., aggregation, bias)\nguidelines for conducting and reporting scientific procedures\na taxonomy of behavioral interventions\nmany practical and positive examples of evidence-based\npractices\nyou will NOT, however,\nreceive training in…\nmathematical analysis\nadvanced programming skills\nHow should you use this\nwebsite?\nThis website is designed to help course participants get an overview\nof the course and access most course materials (e.g., recommended\nbackground readings and videos, additional non-mandatory readings). A\nnumber of other resources, however, are available. An FAQ forum\nis available on ADAM. Information about the exam is available on the Exam tab on this webpage.\n\n\n\n",

The goal is to use linear regression to model your own\njudgments so that you can answer the questions at the bottom of this\npage. If you didn’t participate in the experiment you can still complete\nthe exercise using one of your colleague’s data.\nYou can type the commands below into a new R file to load the\nnecessary R libraries and retrieve the data (please note that copy and\npasting may not always work because incorrect characters are copied in\nthis process). After that, you will have to write your own code to use\nregression to model your own ratings (but I provide some example code\nbelow)…\nLoading packages\nYou will need a couple of R packages to do some data wrangling and\nplot things. For this you will have to load them using the command\nlibrary(PACKAGENAME).\nNOTE: If you never used tidyverse before, you will have to install it\nfirst by using install.package(“PACKAGENAME”). Once you have installed\nthe packages, it will be sufficent to use library(PACKAGENAME) at the\nstart of each R session - no need to install it again each time.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n\n\nReading in the data\nI have uploaded the data on github so R can read the file directly\nfrom there.\n\n\ndata <- read.csv(url(\"https://github.com/matarui/ebdm/raw/main/materials/data.csv\"))\n\n\n\nPlotting all data\nPerhaps it is helpful to see all the data in one plot. The figure\nbelow plots the actual criterion on the x-axis against your ratings on\nthe y-axis? Can you find the subplot with your own data? How did you\ndo?\n\n\nggplot(data,aes(x=crit,y=prediction)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~code)\n\n\n\n\nSelecting YOUR data\nYou can select your own data and plot it. In the example below I use\nthe data from participant “JW2648”\n\n\nmydata<-data %>% \n  filter(code==\"KMT\") \n\nggplot(mydata,aes(x=crit,y=prediction)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nModeling the ENVIRONMENT\nBefore you continue with modeling your data, perhaps it is helpful to\nunderstand the problem you were given (and recall how to run a\nregression in R). Each job candidate was described on 4 cues: Data\nskills, Language skills, Social skills, and Experience. On each cue, a\ncandidate could score either “Ok” (0) or “Great” (1). Now, one can use a\nregression model to estimate the weight associated with each cue. In the\nmodel below, I am using a linear regression to assess how much weight to\ngive each cue.\nNOTE: I’m cheating a little bit because I’m taking out the intercept\nin the model (this is what the “-1” does in the formula below; I\nactually know (because I constructed this example) that the intercept is\n0 and can be ignored - and removing the intercept (i.e., setting it to\n0) is helpful later when modeling the data because the cues are more\neasily interpretable.\n\n\nmodel_env=lm(crit~-1+Data+Language+Social+Experience,data=mydata)\nsummary(model_env)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = crit ~ -1 + Data + Language + Social + Experience, \n    data = mydata)\n\nResiduals:\n       Min         1Q     Median         3Q        Max \n-2.474e-15 -3.177e-16  6.174e-17  3.099e-16  9.148e-16 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error   t value Pr(>|t|)    \nData       4.000e+00  3.865e-16 1.035e+16   <2e-16 ***\nLanguage   3.000e+00  3.865e-16 7.761e+15   <2e-16 ***\nSocial     2.000e+00  3.865e-16 5.174e+15   <2e-16 ***\nExperience 1.000e+00  3.865e-16 2.587e+15   <2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 8.643e-16 on 12 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:      1, Adjusted R-squared:      1 \nF-statistic: 1.74e+32 on 4 and 12 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16\n\nCan you interpret the coefficients presented above? What does the\n4.000e+00 mean?\nPlease note that you can also get a “prediction” from the model, that\nis, the rating that the model suggests each candidate should obtain\ngiven the candidate’s cue profile - I do this below when I use the\nfunction predict(). Then, one can correlate the criterion (the values\nstored in mydata as the column “crit”) and the prediction from the model\n- for which I use the function cor() below.\n\n\nprediction<-predict(model_env)\n\ncor(mydata$crit,prediction)\n\n\n[1] 1\n\nThe correlation between the model prediction and the criterion is 1!\nThis suggests that the linear model captures the environment perfectly\n(perhaps you noticed above that R even gives you a warning “essentially\nperfect fit: summary may be unreliable”). Why is this?\nWell, I picked an “easy” environment in which each cue gives you a\nround number of rating points (say 4 for the cue Data, as indicated in\nthe coefficient estimated at 4.000e+00; with the other cues receiving\nthe weight 3, 2, and 1). Further, there is no noise around this\ncriterion: As you can seen in the table below, the worst candidate,\nJoana, has 0 points, while the best candidate, Tina, with “Great” on all\nfour cues (4+3+2+1), gets exactly 10 points. Everyone else gets\nsomething in between…\n\nnames\nData\nLanguage\nSocial\nExperience\ncrit\nJoana\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nFilipa\n1\n0\n0\n0\n4\nSimone\n0\n1\n0\n0\n3\nUlrike\n1\n1\n0\n0\n7\nUte\n0\n0\n1\n0\n2\nRita\n1\n0\n1\n0\n6\nBettina\n0\n1\n1\n0\n5\nGuilia\n1\n1\n1\n0\n9\nFernande\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\nMaria\n1\n0\n0\n1\n5\nBela\n0\n1\n0\n1\n4\nSalome\n1\n1\n0\n1\n8\nManuela\n0\n0\n1\n1\n3\nDominque\n1\n0\n1\n1\n7\nJule\n0\n1\n1\n1\n6\nTina\n1\n1\n1\n1\n10\n\nSo, can you answer these\nquestions?\nNow, if you use the logic above (and similar code) using your\nratings, can you answer the following three questions?\nHow well did YOUR “clinical” judgment do overall, that is, what is\nthe correlation between your ratings and the criterion?\nHow much weight did YOU give each cue?\nHow much better/worse does a regression model of YOUR judgments, an\n“actuarial model”, do relative to your “clinical” judgment? In other\nwords, what is the correlation between the predictions of a model based\non your ratings and the criterion?\nIf you’re able to answer the questions above, you could try doing the\nsame based on data from a few other students, do you get similar or\ndifferent results?\nNOTE: It’s quite common to get some error messages when starting to\nuse R, if you don’t understand R’s error messages, search Google for\nanswers and potential solutions - it’s what data analysts do ALL THE\nTIME! Of course, let me know through the FAQ on ADAM if you get stuck -\nI’ll come to the rescue or walk you through it during one of the next\nsessions!!!\n\n\n\n",
