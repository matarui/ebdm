  Can algorithms help YOU make better decisions?

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T)
```

## Load libraries
```{r, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

## Load data
```{r }
data <- read.csv(url("https://github.com/matarui/ebdm/raw/main/materials/data_2023.csv"))
```

Here's the data we're modeling...

```{r}
ggplot(data,aes(x=crit,y=prediction)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~code)
```


1) How well did YOUR "clinical" judgment do overall, that is, what is the correlation between your ratings and the criterion?

```{r}
mydata<-data %>% 
  filter(code=="KMT") 

mymodel=lm(prediction~-1+Data+Language+Social+Experience,data=mydata)
summary(mymodel)

cor(mydata$crit,mydata$prediction)
```

This amounts to *achievement*.

2) How much weight did YOU give each cue?

This amounts to the coefficients in the summary of the model above (e.g., Data, Language, Social, Experience).

3) How much better/worse does a regression model of YOUR judgments, an "actuarial model", do relative to your "clinical" judgment? In other words, what is the correlation between the predictions of a model based on your ratings and the criterion?

The performance of a paramorphic model of your judgments amounts to *bootstrapping*. The difference between this model and your clinical judgment is how much better the algorithm does relative to your clinical judgment. The *diff* is given for everyone in the table below... 

```{r, echo = F}

results<-data %>% 
  group_by(code) %>% 
  mutate(model=predict(lm(prediction~Data+Language+Social+Experience))) %>% 
  summarize(achievement= cor(prediction,crit),
            responselinearity=cor(prediction,model),
            bootstrapping=cor(model,crit)) %>% 
  mutate(diff=bootstrapping-achievement) %>% 
  ungroup()

```

```{r,echo=F}
results<-results %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round,digits=2)

kable(results)
```
